## 1 - Introduction
Autism is a developmental neurological disorder that manifests in childhood and continues throughout the individual's life. This disorder impacts communication, social interaction, and the behavior of those who suffer from it. Given the increasing prevalence of autism in recent decades, there is an emphasized need to develop effective intervention strategies to improve the quality of life of people with autism [3].

Early intervention and continuous support are crucial to assist children with autism in developing essential skills and adapting to society. In this context, the TEACCH method (Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication-handicapped CHildren), developed at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, has proven to be a valuable educational and therapeutic approach, focusing on the individual skills and needs of each child with autism. However, implementing this method can be challenging due to the varied needs and abilities of each child [1].

Autism, an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), presents unique challenges in communication, social interaction, and behavior patterns, which can be restrictive and repetitive [2]. Although the exact factors leading to autism are still under investigation, it has been demonstrated that both genetic and environmental components play significant roles.

With prevalence that has increased over recent decades, there is a growing demand for effective interventions that enhance the quality of life of individuals with autism [3]. This is where intervention strategies such as the TEACCH method come into play.

Invented by Dr. Eric Schopler at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, the TEACCH method focuses on visual learning and uses various visual aids to facilitate the acquisition of skills and concepts [4]. However, one of the main drawbacks of TEACCH is its lack of a robust interactive component [5].

The world of technology has provided solutions to this limitation, particularly robotics. The interactivity and predictability of robots make them beneficial tools for children with autism, who often find difficulties in the unpredictability of human interactions [6].

Some studies have shown that children with autism are naturally attracted to technology, and robots, with their interactive and dynamic nature, can be particularly captivating [7]. Additionally, it has been found that interaction with robots can foster the development of social and communication skills in children with autism [8].

Aztec, the experimental robot for intervention in children with autism, emerges as an innovative response to this challenge. It combines the pedagogical approach of the TEACCH method with the interactivity of robotics, providing a more personalized and effective intervention environment for children with autism. With its advanced features, such as the ability to maintain conversations and a comprehensive data storage system, Aztec is positioned as a promising tool for autism intervention. However, its effectiveness still needs to be validated through rigorous research.
